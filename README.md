# 🍎 Nutritional Efficiency Framework: Beyond Calories 🔬

## 📊 Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the **Nutritional Breakdown of Foods** dataset, featuring 3,500+ food items with detailed macronutrient and micronutrient information. The project introduces a novel **Nutritional Efficiency Framework** that transcends traditional calorie-focused approaches to food analysis.

## 🔍 Key Features

- **Data Quality Assessment**: Rigorous identification of data inconsistencies and outliers  
- **Nutritional Efficiency Index (NEI)**: A proprietary metric for evaluating nutritional value per calorie  
- **Unsupervised Learning**: K-means clustering to identify distinct nutritional patterns  
- **Nutrient-Optimized Combinations Algorithm**: A unique approach to food pairing for targeted health outcomes  

---

## 🧠 Methodology

### 1. Data Cleaning & Quality Control

The analysis begins with a thorough assessment of data quality, revealing that **55% of entries** contained potential issues:

- Calorie inconsistencies between reported and calculated values  
- Statistical outliers in various nutrients  
- Extreme values in micronutrient content  

We isolate a reliable **45% subset** of the data for further analysis to ensure credibility.

### 2. Nutritional Efficiency Index (NEI)

The NEI is calculated as a weighted combination of nutrient densities:

This formulation prioritizes nutrients based on physiological importance and scarcity in average diets.

### 3. Nutritional Clustering

Using **K-means clustering** on standardized nutrient profiles, we identified **5 distinct food clusters**:

- **High Sugar, Moderate Carbs** – Primarily fruits and sweetened foods  
- **Protein & Calcium Rich** – Dairy products and legumes  
- **High Vitamin B11, High Fat** – Specialty foods and certain vegetables  
- **Low Nutrient Content** – Refined carbohydrates and oils  
- **Vitamin C Rich, Low Fat** – Primarily vegetables and citrus fruits

### 4. Food Optimization Algorithm

Our novel optimization algorithm finds food combinations that efficiently meet specific nutritional targets while minimizing caloric intake. We provide optimized combinations for:

- Weight loss profiles  
- Muscle building profiles  
- Heart health profiles

## 📈 Key Findings

### Beyond Simple Categories

- Traditional food groups don’t reliably predict nutrient content  
- Clustering reveals **more meaningful nutritional patterns**

### Nutrient Efficiency Leaders

- **Seafood**: Highest average NEI  
- **Legumes**: Top rankings for Completeness Score  
- **Low-calorie vegetables**: Best nutrition-per-calorie efficiency  

### Micronutrient Distribution

- **Vegetables**: Lead in vitamin C density  
- **Beverages**: High calcium per calorie  
- **Fruits**: Surprisingly lower in overall NEI  

### Optimal Food Pairings

- Identified combinations meet nutritional targets within a **5% margin**  
- Low-calorie, high-nutrient foods consistently appear in optimized combinations
